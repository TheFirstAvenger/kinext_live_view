# KinextLiveview

An example app showcasing the [Kinext](https://hexdocs.pm/kinext) library for Elixir with [Phoenix LiveView](https://phoenixframework.org).

To run this demo, you must first install the [`libfreenect`](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect) library.

On MacOS, you can install it with homebrew:

```sh
brew install libfreenect
```

You should also install [`XQuartz`](https://www.xquartz.org/):

```sh
brew cask install xquartz
```

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install --prefix assets`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
